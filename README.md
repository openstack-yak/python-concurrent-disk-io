# python-concurrent-disk-io

Project Focus (problem definition)
----------------------------------
The focus of this project is to explore server functionality that
receives a request from a TCP socket and then simulates a blocking
IO disk read and then returns a reply to the client. Ideally, the
server should support multiple concurrent requests and service
the requests in parallel.

Motivation/Background
---------------------
The motivation for this project comes from OpenStack Swift where
the 'object server' (written in Python and making use of 'eventlet')
could occasionally hang due to dying disk drives that cause excessive
read times (measured in seconds as opposed to milliseconds).

Long Blocking IO
----------------
The fundamental problem is that when hard disk drives are starting
to go bad IO requests to the drive can block for an extended period
of time (tens of seconds). The problem is not present when all disk
drives are functioning normally.

"Just Use Async IO"
-------------------
"Just use async IO" is probably the most common suggested solution
to the problem at hand. Unfortunately, it doesn't solve the problem.
The problem is when the read or write operation starts and it then
hangs. The standard Python implementation uses green threads and
also contains a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that severely limits
parallelism. The presence of green threads and the GIL makes the
problem much worse than would ordinarily be the case -- ALL requests
become blocked on the problematic IO request.

Intent
------
The **intent** of this project is **NOT** to give any opinions or
recommendations, but rather to take an objective look at the
problem and explore various alternatives.

Baseline
--------
The baseline (reference) for this project is the eventlet-based
Python implementation (simulated-disk-io-server.py).

Alternatives Explored
---------------------
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the problem in a concise
and understandable manner and to explore various alternatives (whether
they be eventlet alternatives in Python or even different programming
languages).

Client
------
The client utility used for testing is 'make_requests.py'.
